  This module deploys an AWS Lambda function from a Zip file or from a Docker image. Additionally, it creates an IAM 
  role for the Lambda function, which optionally attaches policies to allow for CloudWatch Logs, Cloudwatch Insights, 
  VPC Access and X-Ray tracing.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).
  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  ```hcl
  module "lambda" {
    source  = "cloudposse/lambda-function/aws"
    version = "xxxx"

    filename      = "lambda.zip"
    function_name = "my-function"
    handler       = "handler.handler"
    runtime       = "nodejs14.x"
  }
